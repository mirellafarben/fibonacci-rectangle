# fibonacci-rectangle
I'm trying to do a Fibonacci rectangle from scratch using arrays, logic and lots of mathematics. 
I'm serious
LOTS.
of.
mathematics.

Oh yeah, I basicaly switch beetween java and javascript because:

-I think is easier to operate with mathematical logic in java, especially 'cause eclipse is such a beautiful workspace.
-I don't know yet how to operate with geometrical forms in java, so I go to java script, which I find easier to use.
-On javascript, contrarily to java, you can save your code and immediatly test it on your browser, which, in my opinion, is better for this whole geometrical space thing.

In few words:
I do the raw maths in java and the geometrical operations I do in javascript.
